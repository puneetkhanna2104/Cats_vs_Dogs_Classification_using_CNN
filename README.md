# Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification_using_CNN
Classification of dogs and cats using Convolutional Neural Network 

Upload the 'kaggle cats vs dogs' dataset to the Google Drive.
We will use that dataset in google drive to train the model in Google Colaboratory. 

A small part of the dataset and less number of epochs is being used so that the model gets trained in less time. 
To increase the performance of the model, you can use the entire dataset and more number of epochs.
